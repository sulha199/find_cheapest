# find_cheapest

Built on ReactJS. It is useful for looking the best price on Indonesia's e-commerces(currently, working on Tokopedia and Bukalapak only). Compiled using webpack. [https://sulha199.github.io/find_cheapest/](https://sulha199.github.io/find_cheapest/).


Next Plan :
* Integrate with CSS preprocessor and maybe React-Bootstrap
* Improve the OO structure. Create (made-up)abstract class for E-commerce-API consumer. Actually, there is no abstract class in Javascript. -> done
* Deploy to a free host, or in Github Pages --> done
* Create Pagination
